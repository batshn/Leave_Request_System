First set up virtual environment on your machine for python using instruction in link below.
https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments

Follow above steps until the "activate" part. Make sure you are outside the source directory
when setting up virtual environment.

Once set up, go into the source directory from terminal and type 
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

All required modules should be installed. If any errors, google it for solutions.
